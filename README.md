# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering
To segment customers based on various attributes like spending habits, age, income, etc., using clustering algorithms like K-Means.
You can use the Mall Customers Dataset or any other dataset that includes customer attributes.
Use data visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots to understand the relationships between variables.
Apply K-Means to group customers into distinct clusters. Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares
Evaluate the clustering results using metrics like the Silhouette Score to determine how well-defined the clusters are.
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., age, income, spending score) to derive insights that could inform marketing strategies or customer relationship management
